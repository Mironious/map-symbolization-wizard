		<p>This Wizard is an online tool that supports cartographic education. Aim of this cartographic platform is to guide users to select right symbols during the creation of their maps. 
		This can be achieved by highlighting a methodological approach, based cartographic visualization principles and methods. A dynamic algorithmic process will be a ration method to encounter problem of visualizing a geospatial phenomenon. 
		This process is based on parameters related to the nature of that phenomenon and the data which are provided from the user. Thus this application accepts them as input elements, and as a result indicates an appropriate symbolism. 
		Due to the needs of this project used various geographical data, which are retrieved from http://geodata.gov.gr/ and http://www.naturalearthdata.com</p>
		<h5>Sample Data.</h5>		
		<p>The first menu is Sample Data which is a simple version of this application. In this menu users are able, through a series of selections, to choose correct symbols for their maps. These selections are based on the nature of data that are going to be displayed on the map. 
		First a submenu in the left is available and contains steps that users will have to follow. These steps are: Data type, Hierarchy, Processed data, Summary. Then taking into account the data users want to represent, they provide suitable information in every step. 
		It is worth mentioning that step Processed is available only when Data type: Area and Hierarchy: Ordinal/Interval are selected. Also, at this step an appropriate data selection is Primary or Derived. Then an overview step follows to check all selections. 
		Also during this process users are able to turn back and for corrections. Finally as a result, maps images will be displayed providing symbolization solutions.</p>				
		<h5>Geoserver</h5>
		<p>TThis menu is a more complicated version than the pervious one. As before users can make selections based on data’s nature. 
		In this version results will be layers with the right symbolization according to selections made.</p>		
		<p>Furthermore, a map with information from Geoserver is located at the right side of the page, and at this section result layers are displayed. 
		First a submenu is on the left side, there users can choose New Button to create a new layer. Then a simple pop-up menu will appear and they will be able to make the selections based on 
		data, as foretold at Sample Data. Selecting a layer from the layers section (area below the submenu) and then choosing Delete, users can delete that layer. In addition Scale and Zoom buttons 
		toggle control elements in the map area. Last is a Print Button which opens a new tab on browser with the current map. In addition users can handle visibility settings of all layers, 
		by clicking a layer and then the checkbox in front of its name; this toggles the layer’s visibility. Also another way is by moving the slider bar under that layer, which will change the 
		opacity. Except that, users can change order of the layers. Simply by dragging and dropping them. Finally users can rename layers by double clicking their names.</p>
		<h5>Custom Data.</h5>		
		<p>This section has similar functionality with Geoserver. There are limitations regarding data selections and representation. This part is connected to an OpenStreetMap tile server, 
		and users are able to upload data in a correct file format. File types can be GeoJSON, TopoJSON, KML and OSM. Also users must select a projection. A difference in this menu is New Button 
		functionality, which is connected to a different pop-up menu. At this point, data only will be displayed in the map with no styling. This part is useful because users can test their data sets, 
		also in future development it will be possible for users to upload a sample data set and the application will provide right symbolization for that specific data set.</p>
